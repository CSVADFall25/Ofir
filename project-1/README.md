# PondSketch Project

## Overview

This project is an interactive drawing experience built with p5.js, centered around a pond scene. This was inspired my an air-dry clay project I was doing with a friend last week, in which we tried to make a whimsical jewlery plate integrating frogs and mushrooms.

The goal was to create a visually engaging and relaxing environment that encourages creativity and experimentation, with a "game" element of fishing for emojies, or, if the user prefers, simple drawing on the pond surface to create a serene scene.

## Functionality

## Design Principles

The design focuses on being simple, calm, and a little playful. The color palette uses soft greens and blues to make the pond feel like the center of the scene, while a few brighter accents draw attention to buttons and tools. Everything is arranged to feel balanced without crowding the space. The controls stay minimal and visual so people can figure things out just by trying them. The goal was to make a drawing tool that feels easy to explore rather than something that needs instructions.

Instead of checking what someone draws using perfect vector lines, the project looks at the actual pixels. When a player finishes, both their drawing and the target emoji are turned into small black and white masks and compared using a Dice score to see how closely they match. Working in bitmap space lets the program see the full picture, including messy strokes and softer edges, which makes the evaluation feel more natural and forgiving. It turns a simple technical test into something that feels more like a creative conversation between the player and the system.
